Isolation Kernel
================

Isolation Kernel (IK) is first introduced as an alternative to existing data independent kernels such as Gaussian and Laplacian kernels. IK has the following distinctive features:

I. IK is derived directly from data and has no closed from expression.

II. Its kernel similarity is data dependent: two points in sparse region are more similar than two points of equal inter-point distance in dense region.

III. It has a sparse and finite-dimensional feature map.

 

IK's unique feature map (feature III) has led to the following advantages:

* Enabling efficient dot product and GPU acceleration (if realized using Voronoi diagram) [2, 4]
* Using Isolation Distribution Kernel (IDK) with kernel mean map, it enables linear time algorithms which would otherwise be impossible---algorithms relying on a point-to-point distance/kernel for their basic operations have at least quadratic time [5, 6, 9]

 

IK's data dependency (feature II) has led to improved task-specific performance in the following tasks:

* Classification: SVM [1], SVM multi-instance learning [3], large scale online kernel learning [4]
* Clustering: DBSCAN [2], psKC [9], Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering [8]
* Anomaly detection: point anomalies [5], group anomalies [6]
* Graph kernel [7]

 

Note that Isolation Kernel is not one kernel function such as Gaussian kernel, but a class of kernels which has different kernel distributions depending on the space partitioning mechanism employed. There are currently three possible implementations: (a) Isolation Forest used in [1,7]; (b) Voronoi diagram used in [2,3,4,8,9]; and (c) hyperspheres used in [5,6].


The codes provided here are IK [1,2], IDK [5,6], IGK [7] and IK-OGD [4].
